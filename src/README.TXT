PROJECT TITLE: Editor1 and Editor2
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Write methods that carry out basic line editor operations like; left arrow, right arrow, delete, and add a letter.  
  The methods will make extensive use of the string methods, substring and length.  The two classes will demonstrate two different 
  approaches to the underlying implementation and show why encapsulation is a good idea. 
VERSION or DATE:  6/11/19
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: If you use BlueJ you can create a new EditorPanel1 (or EditorPanel2). This will open up a GUI that allows 
  keystrokes (right arrow, left arrow, delete, backspace, etc) that a typical line editor would process.  If the methods are properly
  written, the line editor will behave as expected.  On other IDEs (like DrJava, JGrasp, Eclipse) run the main method of Run1 or Run2.
AUTHORS: Kyle Gillette and Tyler Middleton, based on the editor problems from How to Design Programs.
